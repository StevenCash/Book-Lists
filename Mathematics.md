A list of actually useful math books that do a decent job of teaching their topic

## Books by Topic

### Calculus

#### **Calculus and Analytic Geometry** by Thomas and Finney

This book was the book used for the standard freshmen calculus classes when I was in college.  It is a decent book, and I had little trouble understanding the material presented in it.  I will say that I thought the chapter on series convergence tests could be better, and you will need supplemental material if you are looking to learn vector calculus.

#### **Calculus** by Michael Spivak

This is not an introductory Calculus book, but if you want a better understanding of calculus, are a math major, or are a graduate student in science or engineering you should read this.  It can be thought of as a sort of introduction to real analysis.

#### **Div, Grad, Curl, and All That: An Informal Text on Vector Calculus** by H. M. Schey

A great informal text that discusses how to think about vector calculus operations.



### Proofs

#### **Book of Proof** by Richard Hammack

Good book on methods of formal mathematical proofs, and it is free.

#### **Discrete Mathematics** by Chartrand and Zhang

This is a discrete math book, but the opening chapters cover things like proofs and induction.  



### Linear Algebra

#### **No BS Guide to Linear Algebra** by Ivan Savov

This is a fantastic book on linear algebra and actually explains what a number of things like eigenvectors and bases are rather than just giving a procedure for calculating them.



### Analysis

#### **Analysis I & II** by Terence Tao

This is the only real analysis textbook I have found that is understandable.  Some of them might be ok if used in a course and supplemented by an instructor, but they are useless in a stand-alone context.  Saying it is understandable doesn't mean it is always easy or all of the problems are easy, but then again the subject is intended to be rigorous.  If you are trying to learn this subject on your own start with this book.

#### **How to Think About Analysis** by Lara Alcock

This isn't an analysis textbook, but is rather a sort of supplemental text to help understand the topic.  I thought it was really good and highly recommend it.  The author has some other good books as well that are worth checking out.



### Fractals

#### **Make Your Own Mandelbrot** by Tariq Rashid

This is a really cool little book that explains how to generate a Mandelbrot set in Python and plot it.  Not a heavy math class, but a lot of fun and gives some quick results.  The author has some other fun books worth checking out as well.



### Other

#### **How to Study as a Mathematics Major** by Lara Alcock

This is a good book for a college student looking to major in mathematics, or perhaps even in some other scientific or technical field.  Part is devoted to mathematical thinking, language, and so forth, and the other part is more general advice that should apply to students of any major.  Good practical stuff.
