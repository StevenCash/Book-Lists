A list of actually useful math books that do a decent job of teaching their topic

## Books by Topic

### Calculus

#### **Calculus and Analytic Geometry** by Thomas and Finney

This book was the book used for the standard freshmen calculus classes when I was in college.  It is a decent book, and I had little trouble understanding the material presented in it.  I will say that I thought the chapter on series convergence tests could be better, and you will need supplemental material if you are looking to learn vector calculus.

#### **Calculus** by Michael Spivak

This is not an introductory Calculus book, but if you want a better understanding of calculus, are a math major, or are a graduate student in science or engineering you should read this.  It can be thought of as a sort of introduction to real analysis.

#### **Div, Grad, Curl, and All That: An Informal Text on Vector Calculus** by H. M. Schey

A great informal text that discusses how to think about vector calculus operations.



### Proofs

#### **Book of Proof** by Richard Hammack

Good book on methods of formal mathematical proofs, and it is free.
