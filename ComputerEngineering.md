# **Computer and Software Engineering Books**

This is a list similar to my other book lists, but it covers the subject of software and computers.

## **Books by Topic**


### **General Programming Books**


#### **Teach Yourself C in 21 Days** by Jones and Aitken

If you don't already know C programming, get this book and learn it.

#### **C++ From the Ground Up** by Schildt

If you don't know C++, get this book and learn it.

#### **Programming Windows** by Charles Petzold

I have the 5th edition of this book which covers the Win32 API.  It is invaluable for writing windows programs.  There is at least one newer edition of the book that is written for more modern versions of Windows and makes use of things like C#, however I haven't read that one so I can't speak to its quality.

#### **Programming Microsoft Visual C++** by Kruglinski, Shepherd and Wingo

I have a couple of different editions of this book, one of which is for .net (sixth edition).  They are all good.  They explain how to use visual studio and the Microsoft Foundation Classes to write windows programs.  However, they are written for older versions of Visual Studio and so are somewhat out of date for the latest incarnations of the Visual Studio IDE.  Even being dated, some of the information is still useful.


### **Books on Specific Topics**

#### **Teach Yourself Data Structures and Algorithms in 24 Hours** by Lafore

Good introduction to the topic, not a textbook but fine as a supplement or for someone looking to learn the basic concepts on their own.

#### **Grokking Algorithms** by Aditya Bhargava

Another conceptual algorithm book, light on code but easy to read and understand.

#### **Make Your Own Neural Network** by Tariq Rashid

This is another awesome book by Tariq Rashid that explains the basics of neural networks and how to create one using Python.  The author gives simple clear explanations and focuses on getting the concepts across rather than burying the reader in mathematical proofs.  I have enjoyed everything I have read by Rashid.

#### **Operating Systems: Three Easy Pieces** by Andrea and Remzi Arpaci-Dusseau

Good book that explains the concepts of what an operating system must accomplish and why.  If you read this first you can then move on to a book specific to a particular OS or aspect of an OS and have a good basis to work from.

#### **Design Patterns: Elements of Reusable Object-Oriented Software** by Gamma et. al.

I haven't read all of this book, but have read parts of it and used several of the patterns.  This is a book any programmer should at least be familiar with.

#### **Dive Into Algorithms** by Bradford Tuckfield

Fun little conceptual introduction to algorithms.  Also a good way to see some of Python's capabilities.


### **Other Useful Books**

#### **Computer Science Distilled: Learn the Art of Solving Computational Problems** by Filho

This book has some good general programming advice.
