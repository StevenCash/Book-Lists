# **Computer and Software Engineering Books**

This is a list similar to my other book lists, but it covers the subject of software and computers.

## **Books by Topic**


### **General Programming Books**


#### **Teach Yourself C in 21 Days** by Jones and Aitken

If you don't already know C programming, get this book and learn it.

#### **C++ From the Ground Up** by Schildt

If you don't know C++, get this book and learn it.

#### **Programming Windows** by Charles Petzold

I have the 5th edition of this book which covers the Win32 API.  It is invaluable for writing windows programs.  There is at least one newer edition of the book that is written for more modern versions of Windows and makes use of things like C#, however I haven't read that one so I can't speak to its quality.
