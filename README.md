# Book-Lists
Lists of useful books on various topics

In college and elsewhere I have encountered a number of lousy textbooks.  This project contains lists of books that
I have found to be actually useful for learning the subject that they cover.  These are primarily math, science and
engineering books, but in the future I may add other topics as well, and perhaps even a list of interesting fiction.
