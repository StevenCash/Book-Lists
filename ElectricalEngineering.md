# Electrical Engineering Books

Like the math book list, this is a list of electrical engineering books that I have found to be good at actually explaining their topics.

## Books by Topic

### Circuits

#### **Basic Engineering Circuit Analysis** by Irwin and Nelms

We used this book for circuit analysis classes in college and it is a solid textbook.  I admit I haven't seen the newest editions, but the
edition I used explained the material well and contained plenty of good practice exercises.

#### **The Art of Electronics** by Horowitz and Hill

This is a classic electronics book and could fit into several topics, I'll just place it here.  A must have for anyone who works with 
electonics.
