# Electrical Engineering Books

Like the math book list, this is a list of electrical engineering books that I have found to be good at actually explaining their topics.  If you are a student taking one of these courses and your class uses a different textbook than any of these and you are having trouble comprehending the material, I would recommend trying to find one of these and using it as a supplement.  I'm sure there are other good books out there, I am only adding books the list that I have personally read.

## Books by Topic

### Circuits and Electronics

#### **Basic Engineering Circuit Analysis** by Irwin and Nelms

We used this book for circuit analysis classes in college and it is a solid textbook.  I admit I haven't seen the newest editions, but the
edition I used explained the material well and contained plenty of good practice exercises.

#### **The Art of Electronics** by Horowitz and Hill

This is a classic electronics book.  A must have for anyone who works with electonics either professionally or as a hobby.

#### **Microelectronic Circuits** by Sedra and Smith

This is a fantastic introductory electronics textbook.  Highly recommended and widely used.

#### **Foundations of Oscillator Circuit Design** by Guillermo Gonzalez

It has been a while since I read this, but I remember it being a good introduction to oscillator design.

#### **The Design of Low Noise Oscillators** by Hajimiri and Lee

This book analyzes the sources of noise in oscillators and provides methods for reducing said noise.  I read this when I was trying to learn more about phase noise and where it comes from.


### Signals, Controls and Communications

#### **Signals and Systems** by Oppenheim and Willsky

This is the book to get for introductory signals and systems.  

#### **Modern Digital and Analog Communications Systems** by Lathi

This is a good communications book.  It gives clear explanations and covers the basics of the subject.  

#### **Introduction to Probability** by Bertsikis and Tsitsiklis

I haven't found a good introductory book on probabilistic signal processing, but this book covers a lot of the same material and is just a somewhat more general introduction to probabilistic methods.  It is pretty good, better than the others I have seen.  I would still like to find a good book that focused on signals in this area though.

#### **Control Systems Engineering** by Nise

This is a good generic control systems textbook, I had no trouble understanding it.


### Electromagnetics, RF and Antennas

I haven't really found a basic engineering electromagnetics textbook that I like.  If I do, I will add it here.  If you are desperate try Kraus or Cheng.

#### **Electricity and Magnetism** by Purcell and Morin

This is an intermediate level physics electromagnetics textbook.  I read it and found it to be good, however I didn't try doing the exercises so I can't comment on that part of it.  This book provides an explanation of how the magnetic field is a consequence of relativity applied to the electric field, which is interesting and why I read it.

#### **A Student's Guide to Maxwell's Equations** by Daniel Fleisch

A really good book that explains the concepts used in electromagnetics and Maxwell's equations.  It clearly defines and explains things like the vector operations and calculus, which was never covered in any class or textbook I had in college, as well as physical concepts like flux, current density, fields, circulation, etc.  The book more or less takes the equations and explains their physical meaning.  I highly recommend it as a supplement to any mid-level engineering or physics electromagnetics course, though it isn't a textbook.

#### **Practical Antenna Handbook** by Joseph Carr

This is a great book to use to start learning about antennas.  I think it would make a great textbook for an undergraduate antennas class as it explains many of the concepts and practical considerations for working with or designing antennas.  It covers things like propagation, smith charts and impedance, connectors and hardware, antenna geometry and design, etc.  If you want to learn about antennas, you should start here before moving to texts that are purely theoretical and mathematical.


### Digital and Computer Systems

#### **Digital Fundamentals** by Thomas Floyd

A good introductory digital circuitry textbook.  

#### **Digital Design and Computer Architecture** by Harris and Harris

This is a fantastic book that covers digital basics as well as how processors and computer systems work.  If you are learning this on your own and not in a class this is the book I would recommend.  I would call it a little less formal than the usual textbook, but much more practical.  

#### **Computer Networking: A Top Down Approach** by Kurose and Ross

Good book on computer networks, basically drills down through the IP stack layers one at a time and explains each as it goes.


### Other Good Books

#### **Electronic Test Instruments: Theory and Application** by Witte

A book discussing how common electonic test instruments work and how to properly use them to take measurements.  Something not really covered in school but very valuable in the real world.

#### **Noise Reduction Techniques in Electronic Systems** by Henry Ott

This is a classic book that covers all things related to noise, grounding, shielding, cables, radiation, ESD, etc.  A must have for anyone doing electronic hardware design.

#### **Materials Science and Engineering** by Callister

A good entry level materials science textbook.

#### **Introduction to Airborne Radar** by Stimson

Fantastic overview of radar systems.  If you work on or with radar in any capacity you should read this book.  If you work designing technology for the defense industry odds are high you will encounter this book at some point.

#### **The Making of an Expert Engineer** by Trevelyan

This is a sort of career advice type book for engineers.  The author tries to dispel common misconceptions students and beginning engineers hold, and presents case studies of real world situations.  He also discusses teaching, leadership, investing, and a number of other non-technical issues that an engineer must master in order to succeed.

#### **Intellectual Property Law for Engineers and Scientists** by Rockman

Discusses things like patents, copyrights, trademarks, etc.  Basically tells you how to protect your work from being stolen.  Very detailed information on what patents are, what is patentable, how to apply for a patent, etc.

#### **Essentials of Electronic Packaging: A Multidisciplanary Approach** by Viswanadham

Packaging technologies (component and board), interconnections, reliability, failure modes, and other related information.  If you work on electronics this is full of good knowledge.

#### **Engineering Mathematics** by Stroud

Good book for brushing up on all the various math topics you might run into in undergraduate engineering.
