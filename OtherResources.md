### **MIT Signals and Systems Course**

This is a fantastic course taught by Alan Oppenheim of MIT.  It apparently was recorded as a sort of distance learning type thing many years ago.  Combine this with Oppenheim's great book on Signals and Systems and you have everything you need to master the basics of the topic.

### **IIT NPTEL Electromagnetics Course**

This is a set of lectures for an undergraduate electrical engineering electromagnetics course taught by Dr. Harishankar Ramachandran.  I thought it was really good.  I only have a youtube link.

### **MIT Differential Equations**

Professor Arthur Mattuck's Differential Equations class.  Very good.  Most of the MIT video lecture series I have seen are good.

### **MIT Multivariable Calculus**

Yet another great video series by MIT, this one by Professor Denis Auroux.
