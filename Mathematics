<h1>Math Books</h1>
<p>A list of actually useful math books that do a decent job of teaching their topic</p>

<h2>Books by Topic</h2>

<h3>Calculus</h3>

<h4><b>Calculus and Analytic Geometry</b> by Thomas and Finney<h4>
<p>This book was the book used for the standard freshmen calculus classes when I was in college.  It is a decent book, and I had little trouble understanding the material presented in it.  I will say that I thought the chapter on series convergence tests could be better, and you will need supplemental material if you are looking to learn vector calculus.<p>

<h4><b>Calculus</b> by Michael Spivak</h4>
<p>This is not an introductory Calculus book, but if you want a better understanding of calculus, are a math major, or are a graduate student in science or engineering you should read this.  It can be thought of as a sort of introduction to real analysis.</p>

<h4><b>Div, Grad, Curl, and All That: An Informal Text on Vector Calculus</b> by H. M. Schey</h4>
<p>A great informal text that discusses how to think about vector calculus operations.</p>



<h3>Proofs</h3>

<h4><b>Book of Proof</b> by Richard Hammack<h4>
<p>Good book on methods of formal mathematical proofs, and it is free.</p>
